              I am a software engineer that has recently graduated from
              Flatiron. I worked as a systems engineer for Siemens for 9 years
              prior to joining Flatiron. At Siemens I used my organizational and
              analytical skills to plan out projects from start to finish, and
              my communication skills to manage multiple jobs simultaneously.
              However, I found myself wanting to express my creativity and use
              my problem-solving skills. I enrolled in Flatiron for the
              opportunity to express those parts of myself, and so far, I
              havenâ€™t been disappointed.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2 font-bold leading-8 tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-lg text-lg">
              At Flatiron I put my skills in JavaScript, React, Redux, HTML,
              CSS, Ruby on Rails, SQL, Git, PostgreSQL, and Heroku to develop
              and ship 3 full stack applications; Prattle, Reserve Set Play, and
              my capstone project Consumed.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2 font-bold leading-8 tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-lg text-lg">
              I am so excited to continue my software engineering journey to
              create new, world changing technology.
